		<p>A man seeks answers about life, death, and the existence of God as he plays chess against the Grim Reaper during the Black Plague.</p>

		<p>A Knight and his squire are home from the crusades. Black Death is sweeping their country. As they approach home, Death appears to the knight and tells him it is his time. The knight challenges Death to a chess game for his life. The Knight and Death play as the cultural turmoil envelopes the people around them as they try, in different ways, to deal with the upheaval the plague has caused.</p>
